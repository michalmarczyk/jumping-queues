  "Clojure implementation of the real-time persistent deque of Kaplan
  & Tarjan's \"Purely Functional, Real-Time Deques with Catenation\".

  Here real-time means that all operations have O(1) worst-case time
  complexity. The deque is reversible via clojure.core/rseq.

  Use with clojure.core functions:

    1. first / next operate from the left;

    2. conj / peek / pop operate from the left (as with stacks);

    3. rseq flips the deque."
